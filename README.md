# Fire-Extinguishing-robot-w-sound

In this project I worked on the design of a robot which is used to detect and extinguish fires using low frequency sound waves. I also worked on the devolpment of an algorithim to turn towards the fire in one swift movement without the use of PID. This was used to combat the slow proccessing speed of the unit and quickly locate and extinguish fire.
